I would like to begin by sharing my favourite quote:

The repository comprises of 8 exercises:
* exploratory data analysis;
* linear model simulation (Limma) and design matrices;
* mapping and quantification of reads with Rsubread;
* expectation maximization with RSEM;
* edgeR and voom pipelines (exercises 7 and 8);
* clustering using sc-RNA-seq data;
* single cell cytometry using cytof.
